# Developing Testing and Deploying a Crowdfunding Smart Contract with Eth-Brownie on Celo Alfajores. 

- This tutorial puts readers through developing, testing, and deploying a crowdfunding smart contract having extra Utilities and less abstraction that could be used
 in live cases. Included in the Smart Contract are not just utilities for funding but also utilities for a blog, where users can contribute on subjects, 
 get informed and updates on funding, tackle issues, and could even grow a community. Another utility that will be created would be a utility for Handing out 
 Awards in the form of tokens to our donors since the contract will be based on an ERC721 Token standard Created for NFTs (Non-fungible Tokens). 
 For the purpose of handing out tokens to our donors. This tutorial contains a reserved section that explains just enough for this project, 
 on Generative Art i.e. generating unique images for our tokens using an art engine.
